Kivy Guide
LABELS: try setting hints to None if it does shit e.g. setting size doesnt work
    size: outer dimensions of the label widget, available space, can be set to texture_size to show everything
    text_size: can be set to limit texture size e.g. cut off text, can be set to size to show all that fits bounding box for text
    texture_size: size of the actual text not cut off(outer dimensions), can set font_size
    always size_hint: None, None when setting size: needed
    halign or valign set position of text within text_size
in canvas: e.g. self.*** acceses the 'parent' widget of the canvas, unlike in other child Instances like Label:
pos: coordinates are always relative to the innermost Layout, not Widget you are in
Widgets: always define size first then pos at least when using top or right.. x:
Never Put comments after canvas: Instruction
How to access Instances or their methods:
    in kv to on_propertychange: id.method() id can be bound within root widget
    in py someinstance.bind(someinstances on_propertychange = self.method_to_bind) passes instance and every property
    by instantiating in python, storing instance
    in python self.ids["id"].method() instances of child widges can be accessed by id (ids is dict with instance as value)
THREAD SAFETY: 
    Clock methods (e.g. Clock.schedule_once()) are thread safe, can be used do execute methods in Kivy thread from somewhere else
    reactor.register_async_callback should also be thread safe, since it uses a Queue
    Simple Assignments are thread safe because of GIL
